# Linear Regression Modeling and Predictive Analytics in R

**Author:** Cassidy Halpin  
**Course:** MIS446 – Business Analytics  
**Date:** June 9, 2024  

## Project Overview

This project applies linear regression modeling to the well-known `mtcars` dataset using the R programming language. The goal was to explore the relationships between vehicle attributes and develop a predictive model for **quarter-mile acceleration time (`qsec`)**.

## Key Features

- Data exploration and correlation analysis  
- Multiple linear regression model development  
- Model refinement using statistical significance and diagnostics  
- Prediction of `qsec` based on new input data  
- Use of visualizations for model interpretation  

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** R  
- **Packages:** `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `car`, `stats`  
- **Dataset:** `mtcars` (built-in R dataset)  

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data wrangling and subsetting  
- Regression analysis and model interpretation  
- Evaluating multicollinearity using VIF  
- Predictive analytics and real-world simulation  
- Clear statistical communication of results  

## Outcomes

- Created a full regression model with five predictors  
- Refined the model to include only significant variables  
- Predicted acceleration times for new vehicle configurations  
- Diagnosed model accuracy and assumptions via plots and residuals  

## Objective

This project reflects my ability to:
- Translate raw data into actionable insights  
- Build and interpret statistical models  
- Communicate technical findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences  

I’m eager to apply these analytical skills in a professional role where data-driven decision-making is central to business success.
